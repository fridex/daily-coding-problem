# Daily Coding Problem Solutions

A set of solutions I wrote for Daily Coding Problem. Note I do not guarantee these solutions to be the most effective ones. I solve these problems just for fun without having premium account so you don't find reference solutions there. This repo is just for fun, but feel free to use code samples or patch/discuss solutions.

Most of the code is written in Python or C++, the numbers of problems are based on my Daily Coding Problems - it might differ with your numbering.

See [Daily Coding Problem](https://dailycodingproblem.com) site for more info.
